# CREATING AN INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN (IDP)

## Preparing your IDP
The purpose of an IDP is to prepare you for your future career. It is important that you think carefully about your individual career goals and the skills that you need to be successful in that career. It is quite likely that your career success will require a much wider range of skills than the ability to design and perform research. Your mentor and other resources at UW and affiliated institutions will be helpful, but you must take primary responsibility for your career preparation.

The most effective way to begin this process is to define your career interest(s), based on your strengths and the jobs that you might want in different employment sectors (e.g. academia, industry, non-profit, government, or other research-related areas). If you find it difficult to identify your career interests, you will find workshops and seminars offered at UW and affiliated institutions that can inform you about these occupations. There are also a number of useful resources on the web:

## Crafting your IDP
Think about where you want to be in your career. Once you have an idea of your career goals, you will need to consider what skills are needed to be successful in that career and how you will develop those skills and gain needed experience. You should involve your mentor and committee members in helping you define what you need and to help you address those needs. This template includes prompts that will guide you in: 1) acquiring discipline specific knowledge and research skills; 2) gaining skills in written and oral communications, including teaching; 3) development of professionalism, management, and leadership skills.

For each goal, identify how you will accomplish the goal and the time by which the goal will be accomplished. No plan exists until the individual steps are defined and a time line is attached. If you can’t decide on your preferred career path now, define what you need to know to make the choice, how you will obtain that information, and the time period over which you will work on determining your path. Execute that plan and then develop the actual IDP as your specific career goals become better defined.

Once you have drafted your IDP, meet with your mentor(s) to discuss the draft, and schedule regular meetings to review and assess your progress. Make use of as many mentors as you find helpful⎯you will find that most people are very willing to help to guide you in understanding your goals and defining what mentoring you need.

Your IDP should be considered a living document that will evolve over time as you move through your training. You will be expected to update it in consultation with your mentor before your annual committee meeting and discuss it at your committee meeting, and perhaps also update it after quarterly or semi-annual meetings with your mentor(s). You will be required to submit your IDP, along with your annual committee meeting report, to the MCB office each year. For each of the sections below, you should indicate the progress you have made since the last update of the IDP, as well as your plans for further development.
